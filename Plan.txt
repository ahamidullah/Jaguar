IDEAS:
	- Device to see people through opaque surfaces.
	- "Tar pit" -- something that slows down everyone in an AOE.
	- Something with mirrors?
	- Motion sensor - hook up to your alert system or a trap?
	- Door controls.
	- Light controls.
	- Clones that you can command (starts midway through the game).
	- When you die you become one of the clones.
	- Planning -- random events?
	- Teleporter?
	- Tracking device?
	- Radio with clones?
	- Intercepting communications? Translation?
	- Jamming communications?
	- Ambush -- the scene after is important. The action itself should feel violent and hectic. After should be a memorable scene.
	- Different types of grenade?
		- Smoke
		- Flashbang
	- Cameras you can place.
	- Night vision.
	- Distractions
	- Monster roaming the ship/area? Ambush it, set up, plan, dramatic.
	- Forming a plan, but also adaptation to new information.
		- Player should be forming a plan but also thinking about how that plan might need to be adjusted to new information.
	- Vary the rate of information flow - change the rate at which the player needs to adapt.
		- Different flows give the encounters a different feel.
	- Make the planning discrete?
		- One departure from the "home base" = one plan + adapt cycle.
		- Not sure -- more fun if things are free-form?
	- Varying impact of new information -- small info and big info.
	- High-level and low-level planning.
		- High-level: What is the goal of this expedition?
		- Low-level: What path am I going to take through this room?
		- New low impact information is there to keep the player engaged, have them constantly excersising planning and adaptation.
		- New high impact information is there to provide a major disruption.
		- Pacing of new high and low impact information determines the pacing of the game.
		- Consistent spikes in high impact information which disrupt the high-level planning give the game a more engaging feeling.
		- Make each expedition feel like a self-enclosed mission by varing rate of new high and low impact info.
	- Player should develop an intuition about new situations by relating them to old situations.
	- Keeping track of the different squads of AI, their movements/capabilities/goals.
		- That info needs to be factored into the player's plans.
		- Engaging one squad while another is nearby might be a bad idea because they all communicate and you might get bum-rushed.
		- Sighting will draw many squads to the area naturally making stealth more difficult.
		- Make the squads visually distinct? Like colors or something.
	- Player's goals:
		- Resources
		- Information
		- Clearing a path to an area
		- Meeting someone
		- Disrupting the enemy
		- Discovering what they need to do to win
	- Some kind of ambient resource management that needs to be done.
		- Gives a reason to have to go back to "home base" periodically.
		- Have to provision and plan there accordingly.
		- High resolution map (player only carries some kind of gimped version with them (upgradable?)).
